<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am a senior Information Technology major with concentration in Web Application Development at George Mason University 
  and I am looking for Web Development and other IT field internship and full-time job opportunities. My main interest is 
  Front-End Web Developer position and to achieve that position, I develop my CSS, HTML skills and continue to improve them 
  with JavaScript and other important skills. I would be more welcome for opportunities with companies that help me improve 
  my skills even further with other new skills.
